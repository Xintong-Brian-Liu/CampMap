What is Population ??
    Population is way of automatically replacing a path in document 
    with actual documents from other collections. 
    E.g. Replace the user id in a document with 
    the data of that user. Mongoose has an awesome 
    method 'populate' to help us. 
    We define 'refs' in ours schema and mongoose uses 
    those 'refs' to look for documents in other collection.
